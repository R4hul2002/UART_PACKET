## **Goal:** Convert parallel packets into serial UART-compatible packets with FIFO buffering and flow control.

**Modules:**
#### RTL Design Files
- `packetizer_fsm.v` - Wraps input data into a packet structure.
- `async_fifo.v` - Buffers data asynchronously between domains.
- `uart_packetizer_top.v` - Top-level wrapper connecting all submodules.
#### Testbench 
- `tb.v`  - Testbench top file with all the functionality covered 
- `ftb.v` - Testbench for FSM 
- `atb.v` - Testbench for Async FIFO

### Constraints

- `const.xdc` - The clock frequency constraints are given here
